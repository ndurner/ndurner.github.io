OpenAI launch „Zero data retention“:

>We recognize that API customers may handle sensitive information, including customer data, which is subject to data protection regulations. You can request zero data retention (ZDR) for eligible endpoints, and may be asked to meet additional requirements. When ZDR is approved, inputs and outputs will not be stored but may still be run through our safety classifiers.

Also:

>We maintain a security program to implement and maintain enterprise-grade security on our products and services:
>SOC 2 Type 2 compliance against the Trust Services Criteria for security
>GDPR
>CCPA and other state privacy laws
>HIPAA
