## News
OpenAI Codex CLI, the standalone GPT-5 â‡† computer interface that's being positioned as a coding assistant, got a major overhaul. It was rewritten from the ground up, and many useful features were added:
* IDE integration
    * there now is a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt)
    * How to activate: click on the OpenAI bloom logo on the upper right to open the Codex pane: ![click-through to open the OpenAI Codex pane in VSCode](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/vscode-codex-pane.jpg). Alternatively, click on the OpenAI logo on the very left pane. This lets you view "Recent tasks" (at the top) and send a new request to GPT-5.
    * Noteworthy features
        * Graphical diff/patch view: lets you view the changes it made right in VSCode, either inline within the chat pane (blue arrows) or in the full document view (red arrows) ![Screenshot of the Codex diff view](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/vscode-diff-view.jpg)
        * Attach images throughout the chat. Codex CLI via the terminal (described below) allowed submitting only one image until a few days ago. Now, you can add images throughout the conversation just like in ChatGPT: ![Screenshot of plus-button with "Add image" menu entry](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/vscode-add-image.jpg)
        * Switch "reasoning effort" during the conversation, rather than just at startup: ![Screenshot of the Reasoning Effort menu](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/vscode-reasoning-effort.jpg)
        * integration with the [asynchronous variant of the Codex](openai-codex-web): ![Screenshot of the Codex "proper" integration](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/vscode-codex-integration.jpg)
* Terminal version
    * improved look & feel, including better compatibility on Windows ![Screenshot OpenAI Codex CLI on macOS](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/codex-cli-terminal.jpg)
    * improved operational quality (maybe due to GPT-5)
* Web-search (through the DuckDuckGo search engine), with follow-up crawling: ![Screenshot of Codex CLI doing an initial web-search and crawling the web](assets/img/codex-cli-native-update/codex-cli-web-search.jpg)
    * Web-retrieval needs [lots of nudging and will only consider partials](https://x.com/ndurner/status/1961105410485547430), though. They are [on it](https://x.com/ah20im/status/1961106969429000335).

## Getting Codex CLI
Users who just want to use it within Visual Studio Code, installing the extension is sufficient. For those who want to (also) use the text-oriented interface (TUI), Codex CLI needs to be installed through the dedicated installation package.

The new Codex CLI version was available before as '@codex/codex-native'. That's not longer true (and leads to an outdated version), the official ways to install Codex CLI are:
* `npm i -g @openai/codex`
* on macOS: `brew install codex`

After installing, you may enjoy free use as part of a paid ChatGPT subscription. To connect Codex CLI with the ChatGPT account, run: `codex login` at the command line or use the "/login" command within Codex CLI. Usage limits are intransparent, but seem generous even with ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Team. Alternatively, Codex CLI should also continue to work on a pay-per-use basis through an API access key.

To confirm that you're running the new Codex CLI, use `--version`:
```
% codex --version
codex-cli 0.25.0
```

## Using Codex CLI for non-coding tasks
As Codex CLI has access to traditional Unix-tools (and on Windows also PowerShell) including the Python programming language, it can be used for higher-level tasks. For a recent research project with lots of data points, I could have loaded the results into a database - and use its built-in data-processing functions for evaluation. That's what I'd always done. Now, I asked Codex CLI to pull the data from the individual JSON result files across different directories, build aggregates & additional computation and populate a Markdown file in a certain way. And it did.
