AI Attribution in Art offers perspectives for tech workers pondering #GenAI disclosure: from subtle references to detailed disclosures, artists and curators are using various approaches to acknowledging AI contributions in their work. 

My article on derived [Perspectives for Software Engineers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilsdurner_genai-modernart-generativeai-activity-7178137327582519297-tv7J?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) examines:
* The "AI Assisted" label used by curator Janet Bellotto
* Segregated disclosure at the Singapore Art Museum
* Integrated disclosure by artist Daito Manabe
* Comprehensive disclosure practices by:
    * üå† the Italian art studio fuse* and
    * üë®‚Äçüé® artist and writer Prof. Lev Manovich

As AI becomes increasingly interwoven with our development lifecycle, tech stacks and products, the art community's thoughtful exploration of authorship, originality, and ethical AI use may offer valuable insights for our own practices. While it's unlikely that there's a one-size-fits-all solution, these examples provide food-for-thought as we consider the nuances of transparent and responsible AI attribution in our own fast-paced industry.

Whether you're a software engineer or in any other role shaping tech solutions, I invite you to explore these perspectives and consider how they might inform our work.
