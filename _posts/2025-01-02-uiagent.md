WirtschaftsWoche, a German business magazine and key source to decision makers, [features German-led (but US-based) AI startup uiAgent](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/dienstleister/uiagent-dieses-deutsche-ki-start-up-will-die-haelfte-der-bueroarbeitsplaetze-ersetzen/30131296.html). Having prototyped [something somewhat similar](aileen) and with top AI Labs preparing launches ([1](https://youtu.be/ODaHJzOyVCQ), [2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maya-murad_opensource-activity-7272667635044028418-Zir-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), [3](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users), and more), their core tech appears unremarkable to me. But their overall narrative is:
* replacing up to 50% of office jobs with their technology mid-term, taking on competitors such as UiPath and targeting also mid-sized businesses through affordable automation
* "Large Action Model" vs. "Large Language Model"; "no hallucination"
* Human-in-the-loop spin: “In the future, the job market will primarily demand experts who can manage AI - essentially serving as managers for digital workers.”

Ethan Mollick in his book [Co-Intelligence](https://www.amazon.it/Co-Intelligence-Living-Working-Ethan-Mollick/dp/0753560771) strikes a more nuanced tone (chapter 5: "AI as a coworker"), but confirms the danger of AI undermining apprenticeship-style professional education (chapter 8).
