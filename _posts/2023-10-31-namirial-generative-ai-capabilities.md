Translation (with OpenAI Whisper):

> ? Artificial Intelligence has undergone a real and strong acceleration and diffusion in all sectors. Could you tell me one application of this technology that has real feedback for you?\
\
! Yes, as far as traditional AI is concerned, I was talking earlier about an automatic onboarding system and, in fact, it is based on machine learning and deep learning techniques to recognize documents, people, etc. Recently, we have introduced some novelties in the field of Generative AI. I will give you an example. When I have to sign a document, I have the opportunity to receive a summary of the document. It is as if I had an assistant who can do the summary of the document, maybe in my language, because the document is in another language, and this allows me to work very quickly and always digitally, without using paper.
