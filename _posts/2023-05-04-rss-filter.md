I have published my content filtering/scoring system for RSS feeds on Github: [FilterRSS](https://github.com/ndurner/FilterRSS).

Of general interest may be how GPT-4 can be used to self-instruct, to build the actual filters from a few examples: [FilterRSS#system-prompt](https://github.com/ndurner/FilterRSS#system-prompt) - or at least give you some ideas for starters.
My use-cases include this leading researcher on Twitter who unfortunately likes to retweet his mindless fanboys who help pay his dues and that witty fashion model also on Twitter who unfortunately likes to celebrate German football. So it’s to drown out the noise, and let the occasional high-quality content through - according to my taste.

As popular media are awash in ["The dangers of AI"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65452940) type of reporting, I found this quote intriguing:
> The challenge, then, is to use GPT 4 as a catalyst for our own growth and exploration, rather than as a substitute for our own minds. By approaching this technology with curiosity, humility, and a commitment to ethical considerations, we can venture beyond Wittgenstein’s walls and chart new territories in language, thought, and human potential
