I have created **G**e**p**pe**t**to's Workbench over the weekend, to simplify working with the OpenAI Playground in several ways:
* defaults to GPT-4
* sets parameters to encourage factual results (and curb hallucination & confabulation)
* declutters the UI
Future plans/wishlist:
* multiple presets/collections of defaults
* auto continuation of long responses, coalescing into one
* outside integration, akin to ChatGPT plugins? Don't know.
As with the original Playground, this is likely not affected by the ChatGPT geo-block for Italy, so should be usable as a (spartan) substitude.
I made it an [Open Source project on Github](https://github.com/ndurner/GeppettosWorkbench), but no directly usable release just yet - waiting for prospective user's requests. Pay-per-use account with OpenAI required.
