Today I found myself involved in the buzz surrounding OpenAI's language models, and it led to an exchange of thoughts with others. One person mentioned using OpenAI's text-davinci-003, which is a powerful language model, but not the latest one. They were using a low temperature setting (0), which results in more deterministic and conservative responses from the model.

Another individual experimented with ChatGPT, which is a different AI language model. They presumably used a higher temperature setting (0.5) implicitely, which led to more unstable and diverse responses. This prompted me to reflect on the trade-offs between stability and creativity in AI-generated text. I likened the first person's experience with text-davinci-003 at the low temperature setting to having a conversation with a "sober grandfather." In contrast, the second person's experience with ChatGPT at the higher temperature setting reminded me of a "chit-chat with its tipsy teenage granddaughter."

During this exchange, I also shared the news about the upcoming GPT-4 API and encouraged others to join the [waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api). The new model promises to bring even more exciting use cases and improvements over the previous versions.
