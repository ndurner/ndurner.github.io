Two recent studies provide insights into the adoption and perception of artificial intelligence in Germany. The Bitkom study on "AI Usage in Germany" and Deutsche Telekom's international YouGov survey paint a nuanced picture that challenges some common assumptions.

## Surprising Findings from the Bitkom Study

The [Bitkom study](https://www.bitkom.org/Presse/Presseinformation/Wirtschaft-wuenscht-sich-KI-aus-Deutschland), presented at the Digital Summit 2024 in Frankfurt, reveals some unexpected trends. Only 26% of respondents view AI as overly hyped - a surprisingly low number given the often vocal skepticism I encounter among German computer scientists. The study also shows that 84% of companies using or planning to use generative AI consider the country of origin important, with 86% preferring German solutions.

However, one concerning finding is that 65% of companies using AI report poor results. While the details behind this statistic would be particularly interesting to examine, they weren't immediately available in the published materials.

One commenter pointed at SAP as a provider of "souvereign" German AI solutions. While SAP is recognized as a niche provider by some business analysts, VAGO Solutions could be one example that unite "German", "competitive" and "sourveign".

## Deutsche Telekom's International Perspective

[Deutsche Telekom's study](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/claudianemat_ki-zeitgeist-umfrage-ugcPost-7252614160021094400-wiMh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), surveying 13,000 people across 13 countries, shows that skepticism towards AI isn't uniquely German. The study emphasizes how both skepticism and admiration for AI capabilities can coexist, with transparency emerging as a key demand from users.

## Filter Bubbles and Representative Views

As noted by researchers like Ethan Mollick, our social media filter bubbles often fail to represent average population views. These studies help bridge that gap, sometimes revealing counterintuitive findings. For instance, the Bitkom study shows that Germans rank AI in art as their least desired application, while the YouGov study indicates moderate acceptance of AI for personal communication like love letters.

This disconnect particularly struck me after my recent experience viewing AI art at MoCA Taipei. The exhibitions there demonstrated AI's potential to enrich and expand artistic expression. However, I remain skeptical about AI's role in personal communication, where its ability to meaningfully enhance human interaction seems limited.
