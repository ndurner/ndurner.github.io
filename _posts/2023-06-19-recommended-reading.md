When talking/writing about OpenAI, you may want to align with their [Brand Guidelines](https://openai.com/brand). E.g., there is no â€žChat-GPT 4.0â€œ. ðŸ˜‡

Speaking of which, I am currently reading [The Alignment Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alignment_Problem). Not finished, but seems like a good & relevant recommendation to make.
