Insightful article in WSJ, as anti-AI sentiment seems to be growing:
> Technology providers increasingly offer kitted-out AI premium products, although they have yet to gain traction among many enterprise customers. Tools like Copilot for Microsoft 365 or Gemini for Google Workspace are turning out to require a lot of hand-holding to make them work in the enterprise, leading some CIOs to question the actual returns they offer against their high price tags.

Also, "AI functionality" disappoints revenue-wise:
> At the same time, offerings from cloud software vendors such as Workday and Salesforce aren’t resonating in the market yet, leading to disappointing earnings, in part, analysts say, because enterprises are leaning toward building custom applications.

(the AI folks at Salesforce publish interesting research papers, so perhaps not an upstream skill issue).
Downstream solution: build you own end-user apps & integrations, based on OpenAI etc. straight:
> With Morgan Stanley’s meeting summarization tool, “some people would argue, well, you can use Zoom to summarize it. Or you could use Teams to summarize it. That’s true,” said David Wu, Morgan Stanley’s firmwide AI head of product & architecture strategy, but he added, “Even if the product may exist, there’s advantages of building and customizing that solve our user needs better.” 

... because business app vendors are not improving on their rushed-to-market AI functionality?
> Wu noted that buying has typically been the company’s modus operandi in the past. But he said, based on the current level of maturity of out-of-the-box offerings, building makes more sense.
