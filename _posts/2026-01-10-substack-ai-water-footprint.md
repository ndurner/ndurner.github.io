Ethan Mollick [commented](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_its-weird-that-water-became-the-issue-for-activity-7414022231959289856-z2y1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw) that he finds it weird that water became **the** issue for why many people publicly dislike AI:
