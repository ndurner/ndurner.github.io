GPT-4o for image generation has been released - as part of ChatGPT and Sora. It supersedes the Dall-E 3 model, which was originally released in October 2023, but remains the best OpenAI image generation model available via their API.

Most notable for me, 4o image generation not just supports text prompts (like Dall-E did), but also image prompts. Gemini has added that capability recently as well, but I find 4o's capabilities (or: steerability, as it's advertised) to be better. Here are two extractive examples, with errors (only) in the small details:

![Extracting a motif from a backpack](assets/img/gpt-4o-image_gen-extract-2.jpg)

And it may be usable to translate slides as well:

Notice however how our profile photos got substituded!
