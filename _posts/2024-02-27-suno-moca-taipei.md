The AI art exhibition [Hello, Human](https://www.moca.taipei/en/ExhibitionAndEvent/Info/Hello,*Human!) currently running at MoCA Taipei features several works created using [Suno AI](https://www.suno.ai/). To my surprise, Suno AI has singing voices! Very beautiful, and only slightly glitchy at times.
