Sparks of AGI, revisited Back in 2023, Sparks of AGI implemented reverse engineering through reverse prompting: GPT-4 instructed the user to run Unix tools like file , strings , a debugger, and a disassembler, and then reasoned from the outputs. The paper’s reverse engineering example is essentially a supervised, tool-mediated process where the model explains each step and the human executes it: the model moves from file format and strings to assembly, then uses a debugger to inspect execution a...
