Wonderful Research paper on "[Mass Editing Memory in a Transformer](https://memit.baulab.info/)". Updating facts is one thing, but there is also the "right to be forgotten" which needs to be addressed by an actually lawful AI. This is based on GPT-2, and OpenAI say they're not training GPT-5. One may wonder what the brainiacs are doing instead, and THIS sounds like something actually worthwhile.
