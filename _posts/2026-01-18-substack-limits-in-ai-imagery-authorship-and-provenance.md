In early 2024, I wrote about an idea borrowed from galleries: [wall labels as UX for AI disclosure](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-attribution-art-perspectives-software-engineers-nils-durner-mx68f). A wall label does two things at once: it gives viewers a shared vocabulary (“digital print”, “oil on canvas”), and discloses how a piece came about. In this analog form, it’s anything but a cryptographic guarantee. It is a social and institutional convention.

Since then, two digitally-native approaches have moved from research and specification work into real tooling:

- **SynthID**: watermark-based signals for AI-generated media, plus vendor tooling to check for those signals.
