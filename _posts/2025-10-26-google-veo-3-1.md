Third parties LetzAI and RunwayML offer Veo 3.1, but don’t include the “Preview” moniker in their model selectors - it remains unclear if it’s the same or a different model. In my one single test on LetzAI, the result - lip-sync from text on a LetzAI-generated photo realistic image - looked inferior to [what I got via the Vertex AI Studio](https://youtu.be/X2xIJO3MqGY).

(Because each run gives different results, this may have simply been bad luck).

One of the special features of Veo 3 series is that, like OpenAI Sora 2, it can optionally generate an audio track matching the video. Unlike Sora 2 in the OpenAI API, Veo 3.1 allows human faces as inputs. This allows users to emulate the RunwayML “lip-sync” feature, where a static input image narrates an input text. (Lip-Sync is cheaper, though: 5¢ per second vs. 40¢ per second for Veo via Vertex AI). In addition to the voice, Veo may add additional background sounds: a (matching) synthetic chirping to the original [Aileen 2](https://youtu.be/mb5GRIMmWGg) starter image an...
