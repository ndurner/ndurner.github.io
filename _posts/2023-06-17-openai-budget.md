During [AI Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7077654613138583553/), we talked about the standard OpenAI account usage limit of $120, and the need to explicitly request & wait for an increase. In addition to the 70â‚¬(?) spent by the other 4 teams, my team has spent 20â‚¬. Now, I just woke up to this note, without having filed such a request:

Perhaps this means that your OpenAI limits automatically increase with your actual usage. So you just can keep Building. ðŸ™‚
