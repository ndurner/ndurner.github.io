Llama 4 has been released - partially. It's a suite of three LLMs, with the biggest model ("Behemoth") still in training. Notes:
* apparently no restrictions on use within the EU
* trained in fp8 precision
* already live on OpenRouter
    * via Together: smallest model "Scout" costlier than Gemini 1.5 Pro on my first tests
    * also available from Groq and Fireworks, much cheaper than Together
* [Hugging Face model collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/llama-4-67f0c30d9fe03840bc9d0164)
