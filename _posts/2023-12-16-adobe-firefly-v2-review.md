Adobe have released Firefly V2 some time ago. It's very good, [random sample from the net](https://x.com/icreatelife/status/1735801210383294725?s=61&t=1UkXMLzJuVuAu7tEUWoR3w) below. All my previous criticisms are void now. Two things I have noticed, though:

- the NLU (natural language understanding) capabilities of the input text prompt is not as strong as with **OpenAI DALL-E 3**.
- I may(!) have seen slight blurriness introduced when working on a delicate pencil-art image. Not entirely sure as it was 1) in the middle of the night and 2) observed on a very good monitor, but given that it was just minor edits at that point, I decided to just send "the other version" to the printer. Just look out for this, to be safe.

If someone is interested in a scrappy Google Colab Notebook for DALL-E 3, I’ll be happy to share. (Own OpenAI access key required as usual).
