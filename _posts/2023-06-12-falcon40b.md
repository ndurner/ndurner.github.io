I tried the "Instruct" finetuned variant of Falcon 40B (ðŸ¥‡ on OpenLLM leaderboard) to format a plaintext list of sightseeing recommendations in HTML and add some links. And this [prediction engine](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export/amp/) (ðŸ™ˆ), the one that ["predicts what words are likely to come next"](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export/amp/) (ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ), glitched out with:

... OK then, in accordance with the prophecy, I'll visit Navigli. ðŸ˜Š
Seriously, though: the results as observed through the Huggingface chat demo are not good: when asking for pure JSON as a result, it works for simple inputs. But I found that more complex inputs derail it, resulting in an answer that includes a satisfactory JSON first and then roughly: "As an AI model, I cannot return JSON. But here's some Python code: ..."
