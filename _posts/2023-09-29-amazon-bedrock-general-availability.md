Amazon Bedrock is Generally Available: [Announcement](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-amazon-bedrock-general-availability-generative-ai-innovations). For everyone who has enjoyed preview access,
these details caught my attention:
* "**Amazon Titan** model usage will be **billed** starting 00:00 PST on Sept 28, 2023."
* "Effective Sept. 18, 2023: Titan Text G1 - **Express** is the new name for model Titan Text Large."

 The only models my personal (thus GA) account can request are the ones from Antropic. Requesting these entails filling a request form, required info includes intended users and description of use cases.
The Titan text model is still in private preview.
Bedrock is not available from EU regions and is only available from: US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio).
