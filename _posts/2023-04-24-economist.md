The [current issue of The Economist](https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2023-04-22) features several articles on AI. These mention the „Common Crawl“ as a data source, rather than „mostly Wikipedia“. (I remember the Common Crawl from the LLaMA context and others, with diagrams available detailing the composition of the dataset besides the C.C.).
