Ethan Mollick describes [the Jagged Frontier of AI](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged) as strong performance on some tasks, brittle or poor performance on others that look similarly hard to humans. It is tempting to assume this frontier advances smoothly over time - as is usual with technological progress.

Helen Toner - interim executive director at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) and former OpenAI board member - adds a useful correction. [In a recent talk](https://x.com/neil_chilson/status/1974539655577264261), she contrasts such “smooth asymptotes” with “transition turbulence”: progress arrives in thresholds and phase changes, not tidy curves. As possibilities of AI change - through technical progress and through policy, and through the disturbances and reactions that follow - the chaotic transitions in fluid heating are a better mental model than a single curve.

That matters for capability expectations and for policy.

### Jaggedness, two ways
