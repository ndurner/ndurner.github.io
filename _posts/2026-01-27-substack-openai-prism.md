Back in October, I wrote about [Writing (a paper) with OpenAI Codex](https://ndurner.substack.com/p/writing-with-codex?utm_source=publication-search) - which worked, but exhibited a few stumbling blocks. Now, OpenAI have released Prism: a writing tool which they pitch at scientists:

> Prism, a free workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT-5.2.
>
> ChatGPT helps you write and refine LaTeX-and supports your research with explanations, proofs, citations, and summaries.

> Ask it anything, upload images, or switch to voice mode and just talk.

Prism, a free workspace for scientists to write and collaborate on research, powered by GPT-5.2.
