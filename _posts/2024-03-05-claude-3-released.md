Anthropic have released the Claude 3 family:
[Announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family).

Early comments from my filter bubble:
* not available in the EU
* hosting options also include Microsoft Azure, in addition to AWS?
* overreaching guardrails: Claude still refuses work at times, e.g. coding a website
may be gaming and misrepresenting benchmark scores. The comparisons they have published are against the original GPT-4, not the current ones

    * https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1764752690360238220
* real-world task performance seems mixed, some praise coding abilities, others don't

* biggest model (GPT-4 competitor “Opus”) more costly than GPT-4 (Turbo?)
* vision on par with GPT-4V?

(I haven't tried any of this myself. Let me know if you'd like my Amz Chatbot to be updated soon'ish.)

Update 1: There seems to be consensus that it is better than 2.1, especially for Summarization.

Update 2: Chat interface for Claude 3: https://huggingface.co/spaces/ndurner/claude_chat
 
This requires an API key from Anthropic themselves as the biggest model "Opus" in particular is not available through AWS.
