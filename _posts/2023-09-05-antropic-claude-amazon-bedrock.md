A [comparison chart of various Chatbots](https://twitter.com/bitfool1/status/1692017968820175160) has raised some questions on Claude 2, in particular the "Free" price tag. Like with "ChatGPT", different people mean different things by it, and it again helps to think in the [categories previously established by Miles Brundage](gen-ai-models-systems-use-cases): Models, Platforms and Systems. Here is his slide extended with Claude 2:
![Claude Model and System](assets/img/claude-2-model-system.png)

* Pink: the chatbot at claude.ai (a System; comparable to ChatGPT)
* Yellow: the Foundation Model (comparable to GPT-4)
    * (also available through Google Vertex AI Model Garden or Anthropic themselves)
* Green: Amazon Bedrock gives access to the Model, and is a Platform (comparable to OpenAI Playground or Google Generative AI Studio)

Some Systems are free (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5, claude.ai), but Models do incur costs (with some limited exceptions, like poe.com, HuggingFace Free tier).
Screenshots of the Claude 2 Chatbot: [Initial Impressions](Anthropic-Claude-2-Initial-Impressions), the [Amazon Bedrock Playground](https://youtu.be/E3PFVwFwR-U?t=195) is much more spartan.

On the question if I agree with the comparison chart: I like Claude 2 because it's more "opionated", and more to the point, while ChatGPT tries so hard to strike a balance. But Claude 2 hallucinates rather badly, so I don't agree that it's more accurate. True, it's more up-to-date, which is a big plus. Bard is entirely useless to me, everytime.
