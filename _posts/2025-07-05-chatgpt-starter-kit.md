The generative-AI gold rush has bred two things in equal measure: astonishing progress and an ocean of low-grade advice. New capabilities ship weekly; yesterday’s “best practice” can be today’s foot-gun.  
Below is a bookmark list that will serve as a stable launchpad.

## 1. Begin with primary sources  
OpenAI’s own material is concise, current, and largely free of hype. Unfortunately it’s scattered, so here's a (non-conclusive) overview:

* [**OpenAI Academy**](https://academy.openai.com/) – live sessions and [recordings](https://academy.openai.com/public/content). Look for the [“Introduction to ChatGPT”](https://academy.openai.com/public/events/introduction-to-chatgpt-9tb8p45jw0) on the 10th this month.  
* [**OpenAI for Startups**](https://openai.com/solutions/startups/) – despite the name, most content applies to others as well 
* [**OpenAI for Business** (LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/openai-for-business/posts/?feedView=all) – quick, scenario-driven walkthroughs.
* [**Put AI to Work for Marketing Teams**](https://openai.com/business/put-ai-to-work-for-marketing-teams) – ignore the title; solid demos.
* [**Collaborative Writing and Coding with OpenAI Canvas**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/collaborative-writing-and-coding-with-openai-canvas/) – inventor Karina Nguyen herself explains OpenAI Canvas, a side-by-side workspace where you and ChatGPT can collaboratively edit and refine text or code
* Plus: the gated *OpenAI "Platinum" Forum* has a wealth of [content](https://forum.openai.com/home/content) also

## 2. Sober macro-perspective  
* [**Ethan Mollick**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/) – his [book](https://www.amazon.de/Co-Intelligence-Living-Working-Ethan-Mollick/dp/0753560771/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KXQB7FJZH64K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UmiRyu9MyDgnZInrbqVe0kcp_QGiUqJfJL7c-fuS1JS5o3QvtEv3IIX3NnzXkYCz4zg8o4T55Cw7UwMnuwGua39n9lVvI7Dp8v98wvf6MtGM1jHIyphamUX4UsKMHP6OhNVIIrl4G6JtKScFL2nopqfS9t9BnXxssvZm34HsZ9U9ynUVLBy3NtcgS7sg05_0KtTxLEZXQ4tdS3IGUium0HLJ3WxxbgdlhmVO1ym5lEI.MT285yvsK3FLmU0QAyb-n1JpX-KUe0kLyMjHS7RXDHo&dib_tag=se&keywords=ethan+mollick+co-intelligence&qid=1751696111&sprefix=ethan+mollick%2Caps%2C114&sr=8-1) gives a crisp overview of “what AI can do.” It predates the o3 modell but is still a useful primer.
  * Tip, for example: [be mindful of ChatGPT’s **Memory** feature](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_very-tight-control_over_ai_memory_is_really-activity-7320938824304316416-aLKc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw).

## 3. Pragmatic cheat-sheets  
* [**Model-picker flow chart**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteroestergaard_promtengineering-ai-chatgpt-activity-7305843623760162816-KdRo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw) – intended to help with the overcrowed model selector in paid-for ChatGPT plans.
* [**... with Prompts included**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anoukmuis_this-visual-just-made-90-of-ai-prompting-activity-7322994166802624512-B5mK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw) ([I am wary, though](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322994166802624512?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7322994166802624512%2C7323270078689390594%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287323270078689390594%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7322994166802624512%29))

## 4. Beyond ChatGPT: Developer superpowers
The polished packaging of ChatGPT comes at the expensive of throttled horsepower - relatively. Developers can interact with the models more directly and exercise greater control - e.g. per Ethan Mollicks advice about "memory", just even more low-level. A ressource handed out at the [OpenAI Hackathon in Paris](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:456c1645bbd44edc8dac9516f8c2afc9@thread.v2/1751355565564?context=%7B%22contextType%22%3A%22chat%22%7D) is the ["OpenAI Dev Resources" Notion Site](https://openai.notion.site/openai-dev-resources).
