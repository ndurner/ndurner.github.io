I got the question what the difference between the [OpenAI Playground "in chat mode"](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat&model=gpt-4) and chat.openai.com is. So for everybody's benefit, my answer reproduced below. If you're not familiar at all, see this screenshot for what I am talking about:

Note that this pay-per-use, so a credit card is required (but a free tier seems to exist for new accounts). Bonus: not geo-blocked in Italy, to the best of my knowledge. Anyway, on to my original answer (translated from German to English by GPT-4 üòÄ):
The difference is at least the System instruction, which is not visible and not directly influenceable in chat.openai (in my terminology "ChatGPT"). I attribute, for example, the fact that ChatGPT seems "moody" to me: one must first soften the basis of these specifications - or something like that.
Also, ChatGPT has these nice formatting features:\

... which, however, are cut off for too long answers and, when prompted to continue, break:\

... and then it just gets annoying.
In the future, there are supposed to be these plugins, through which not only code will be displayed in such a prepared way, but also, for example, WolframAlpha will be directly embedded:\

But that is still behind a waitlist.
So the Playground is more spartan, but as of now, it is actually the better alternative for professional users - especially if you have GPT-4 unlocked there.

Also with ChatGPT Plus:\

(said "default" being GPT-3.5 üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
