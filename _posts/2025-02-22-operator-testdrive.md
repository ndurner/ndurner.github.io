Operator, the browser-controlling agent, is available in most countries where ChatGPT is available except for the EU/EEA. My notes:
* when tasking it with something, it translates the request to a search on Microsoft Bing. The first result is visited - and it works from there
* the UI is a view of the remote browser and a ChatGPT conversation pane on the left
* when user details need to be entered, the user has to take over and enter these themselves
* visiting the first result on Bing may mean Operator may get trapped up in some blog - that turns out to be not helpful. Operator will at some point track back and try other results. Operator keeps several tabs open.
* I suppose there is an emergent need (and opportunity) for SEO activities there.
* booked a bus ticket successfully, payment was done through an E-Wallet
