The "Nvidia & Langchain AI Agents contest" concluded on Tuesday at 2 in the morning, and I'm proud that I crossed the finish line 3 hours early with a little something:
> Introducing 𝑨𝒊𝒍𝒆𝒆𝒏 𝟐: an AI office agent and my entry into the 'NVIDIA and LangChain Generative AI Agents Developer Contest' in the Small Language Model category. AI agents harness the reasoning, planning, and tool-use capabilities of language models to autonomously execute tasks. Aileen 2 amplifies this functionality by integrating visual perception, enabling it to effectively navigate and summarize legislative proceedings from Germany's parliamentary TV Mediathek website — the initial use-case showcasing the system.

Submission materials:
* [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nilsdurner_nvidiadevcontest-langchain-generativeai-activity-7208564239026810880-FWas?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
* [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mb5GRIMmWGg)
* [Github repo](https://github.com/ndurner/aileen2)
* (PaliGemma gated checkpoint shared privately)

It's not as fanciful as I wanted it to be originally as I hit some dead-ends and had to make some cuts in the interest of making the submission deadline, but I learned a lot along the way. As one of the follow-up tasks, I want to investigate why the PaliGemma foundation model gave me different results on Apple Silicon vs. Nvidia RTX.
