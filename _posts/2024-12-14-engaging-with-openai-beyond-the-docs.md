OpenAI provides standard documentation and public announcements, but there are other, less obvious ways to engage with them—some more formal than others. This post reflects on a few of these channels and how I’ve begun to interact with them, without overstating their significance or my role.

### The “OpenAI Forum” Membership  
Recently, I was accepted into a private membership program from OpenAI that they call the “OpenAI Forum.” Not to be confused with the well-known [OpenAI Developer Forum](https://community.openai.com/) that anyone can browse, this new initiative appears to be invite-only and geared toward domain experts, researchers, and people who want to provide feedback or collaborate on certain projects. I sometimes refer to it jokingly as the “OpenAI Forum Society” to distinguish it in my notes, since “forum” naturally implies a traditional message board—this isn’t that. Instead, it seems to be a curated community with events, office hours, and opportunities to contribute to AI-related discussions and possibly influence development directions.

I haven’t attended many events yet or formed a clear picture of how active or valuable this membership will become, but it’s intriguing that OpenAI is creating such spaces. Being accepted felt like a small acknowledgment that my domain interests and perspectives could be of use, even if I’m not entirely sure how I’ll contribute yet.

### Direct Feedback on Model Behavior  
Outside these formal programs, OpenAI employees sometimes invite feedback publicly. For example, **Joanne Jang (Head of Product, Model Behavior at OpenAI)** posted on X (formerly Twitter), encouraging developers at an OpenAI DevDay event to share “model behavior peeves.” Although I wasn’t at the event, I responded online with some observations about overblocking and repetition loops I’d seen in GPT-4o Vision. Joanne kindly asked for more details and, after I provided some examples, even offered me some API credits as a token of appreciation. We didn’t continue an extended back-and-forth, but it’s still worth noting that OpenAI staff occasionally engage directly with community members in this way, listening to feedback on model performance and reliability.

### Public Resources and Developer Engagement  
For those who prefer more structured and openly accessible content, OpenAI’s Build Hours (archived on Vimeo) present coding demos, best practices, and discussions around working with their APIs and models. The Startup Program similarly offers resources and guidance, aiming to support developers who are building on top of OpenAI’s technology. These more public-facing efforts don’t require invitations or acceptance processes, making them accessible and inclusive for anyone interested in improving their understanding of OpenAI’s tools.

### Reflecting on These Multiple Avenues  
Each of these channels—private membership groups like the “OpenAI Forum,” occasional personal interactions with staff on social media, and publicly accessible educational sessions—represents a different kind of engagement. None guarantees influence or special access. Instead, they collectively form a network of opportunities: to learn, to provide feedback, to watch others build, or to participate in more focused conversations if one’s background aligns with OpenAI’s interests.

I’m still exploring where I can offer meaningful input. The Forum membership might eventually lead to deeper conversations or more direct chances to influence training projects or evaluations. Or it may simply remain a small nod to involvement, overshadowed by the richer materials and sessions OpenAI shares widely with the entire developer community. Either outcome is fine—my main interest remains understanding the technology better and seeing how, as a community, we can nudge these tools toward reliability, usefulness, and responsible deployment.

For now, I’ll keep an eye on the various events, pick sessions of interest from the Build Hours, and remain open to sharing observations when staff members reach out. The fact that these different avenues exist at all suggests that OpenAI is inviting multiple forms of engagement—from casual, public learning experiences to more curated and possibly impactful dialogues.
