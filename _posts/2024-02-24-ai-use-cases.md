Business analysts all have their own theories and predictions on GenAI. One evergreen is "summarization", perhaps gleaned from Model Cards. Same for the recent [Forrester event in Milan](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/manjurizzi_generativeai-digitaltrustservices-activity-7167120004323164160-sqnC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
> The other main reason consumers are using AI, in Italy but especially in Germany, is to summarize something. 

[My observation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167120004323164160?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7167120004323164160%2C7167678285106130945%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287167678285106130945%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7167120004323164160%29) is different:
> Anecdotally, random people I meet tell me that „writing E-Mails“ is their top AI use-case. When I ask which product or model they use, it‘s always the free version of ChatGPT (so the one with the least assurances). I have concluded for myself that privacy may actually not matter much in daily business practice - and anyone should be conscious that their E-Mail exchange likely gets fed to the consumer version of ChatGPT at some point (mine certainly has been as well).
