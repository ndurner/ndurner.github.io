OpenAI have released GPT 4.5 in preview:
> GPT‑4.5 is a very large and compute-intensive model, making it more expensive⁠ than and not a replacement for GPT‑4o.

The [System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf) remarks reduced hallucination, practical use on the API confirms it's also much slower in terms of tokens per second. [Priced](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing) at $75.00
$37.50/$150.00 (input/output), it's even more expensive than the original GPT-4 at $60.00/$120.00 (not taking into account the recent tokenizer improvements, this could cancel out). 

Availability in the API for production is [not certain](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/), however:
> Because of this, we’re evaluating whether to continue serving it in the API long-term as we balance supporting current capabilities with building future models

So it will be vital to provide [feedback](https://community.openai.com/).

[Update]
* knowledge cut-off is October 2023. (confirmed by asking for the latest #rustlang version)
* still, "incredible world knowledge" [is claimed](https://x.com/aidan_mclau/status/1895204587608645691)
* it's vision capabilities are lauded: 
Derya Unutmaz, MD has shared a [real-world case from Medicine](https://x.com/DeryaTR_/status/1895249875723321560) where other models failed before. [ChatGPT is inconsistent](https://x.com/DeryaTR_/status/1895282778012557700), but GPT-4.5 via API [worked in 5/5 cases](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7300992529464729604?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7300992529464729604%2C7301096259493285888%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287301096259493285888%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7300992529464729604%29) (as far as I can tell!).
* [Proposed System Prompt](https://x.com/nikunjhanda/status/1895262328909897762):
> You are a highly capable, thoughtful, and precise assistant. Your goal is to deeply understand the user's intent, ask clarifying questions when needed, think step-by-step through complex problems, provide clear and accurate answers, and proactively anticipate helpful follow-up information. Always prioritize being truthful, nuanced, insightful, and efficient, tailoring your responses specifically to the user's needs and preferences.

The mechanisms for this API use are basically the same as the ones described in my article about [AI-assisted Process Visualization](ai-assisted-process-visualiaztion-collaboration)
