OpenAI have released GPT 4.5 in preview:
> GPT‑4.5 is a very large and compute-intensive model, making it more expensive⁠ than and not a replacement for GPT‑4o.

The [System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf) remarks reduced hallucination, practical use on the API confirms it's also much slower in terms of tokens per second. [Priced](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing) at $75.00
$37.50/$150.00 (input/output), it's even more expensive than the original GPT-4 at $60.00/$120.00 (not taking into account the recent tokenizer improvements, this could cancel out). 

Availability in the API for production is [not certain](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/), however:
> Because of this, we’re evaluating whether to continue serving it in the API long-term as we balance supporting current capabilities with building future models

So it will be vital to provide [feedback](https://community.openai.com/).
