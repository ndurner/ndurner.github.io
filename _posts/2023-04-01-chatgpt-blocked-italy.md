Alarming news from Italy: ChatGPT got blocked. After investigating the matter with my colleagues, I learned that only the ChatGPT product was affected, while other infrastructure parts remained accessible. We discovered that software creators and their customers who rely on OpenAI and its APIs, including GPT-4, are not affected by this block. In fact, one of my colleagues confirmed that my Siri Shortcut integration, which relies on GPT API calls, is still working.

While the mandate of the Italian authorities seem harsh, it is reassuring to know that developers and users of other OpenAI products are not impacted.

Technically, it seems to be a geo-block, put in place on the side of OpenAI:

Paying users may expect to get their money back:
