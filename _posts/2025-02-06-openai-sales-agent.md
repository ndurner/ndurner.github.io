A "Virtual Sales Associate" was showcased briefly by OpenAI, perhaps as something like GPTs: "Enterprises can start to *customize* these applications [agents?]". Also, OpenAI may be going after the data inside organizations: "The most valuable data is the data you have in your company. You can imagine us to expand Deep Research to internal information."
