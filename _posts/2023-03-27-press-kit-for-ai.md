[JÃ¶rg Lenz](https://de.linkedin.com/in/joerglenz) shared today the article 
[Superhuman: What can AI do in 30 minutes?](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/superhuman-what-can-ai-do-in-30-minutes) and his thoughts on why and how this might be a great tool to draft marketing campaigns. 

Related idea: new-age press kits that establish
* the ground truth (like, quick facts for the AI)
* the grounding itself (helpful prompt engineering so I won't freewheel)
so writers/analysts/... may have their content created based on that.
Given the breakneck speed of advances, it may, however, be either too soon or too late for this. ðŸ˜‰

(and by "quick facts for AI" I mean something that is not necessarily meaningful to humans - just some ultra-condensed "tokens", that get the AI on track, while also optimized for constrained context space)
