To continue the trend of "long-running AI", OpenAI have launched "Deep Research" (not in the EU, though):
> Deep research is OpenAI's next agent that can do work for you independently—you give it a prompt, and ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst. Deep research may take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes to complete its work, taking the time needed to dive deep into the web. The final output arrives as a report within the chat – in the next few weeks, we will also be adding embedded images, data visualizations, and other analytic outputs in these reports for additional clarity and context.

Their blog has a [side-by-side comparison](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#:~:text=needle%20in%20a%20haystack) between GPT-4o and Deep Research and some [more examples](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/#:~:text=Expert-level%20task%20examples).
