Inspired by some recent discussion about website optimization, I have posed a query for factual background information to Bing Copilot - which I have recently come to like. In my tests, this pulled background information from a relevant Confluence and Service Desk, but mixed up two products by the same company - while I was actually looking for mention of a third one (through by deliberately vague & ambigous questioning). 

Building on my original idea of a ["press kit for AI"](https://ndurner.github.io/press-kit-for-ai) to ground LLM responses in actual facts, I propose to bolster public information outlets that companies control with clarifications to aimed at AI crawlers and
test new public pages in terms of AI (dis)utility.

These excercises can be seen as "improving UX", as the confusion to these non-humans may highlight problems that actual humans could experience as well. I suppose that clearing such issues up would be a cross-team effort, and not just the responsibility of webmasters.

Note that there are other engines like this, and may well be the future of Internet Search.
