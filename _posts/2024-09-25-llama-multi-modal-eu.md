Llama 3.2 just got released, and as announced earlier, the multi-modal models are not available in the EU. From their Acceptable Use Policy:
> With respect to any multimodal models included in Llama 3.2, the rights granted under Section 1(a) of the Llama 3.2 Community License Agreement are not being granted to you if you are an individual domiciled in, or a company with a principal place of business in, the European Union. This restriction does not apply to end users of a product or service that incorporates any such multimodal models.

The model pages on Hugging Face bear an access barrier that states that:
> Meta-llama has disallowed access to this model in the EU. Downloads of this model are not accessible from the European Union (EU). Please see the Llama Acceptable Use Policy and License FAQ page for more information.

The non-vision 1B and 3B models are available as usual.
