Microsoft Research paper: ["Early experiments with GPT-4"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf). With ChatGPT Plus largely being vaporware at this point, this is a nice overview of what to reasonably expect. I haven't finished it yet, but things worth pointing out:
1. drawing vector graphics in LaTeX
1. reverse prompting to
* retrieve up-to-date information from the web
* do calculations

I did a practical test of #2, and now it can finally answer the question we're most interested in: "Who is JÃ¶rg Lenz?"
