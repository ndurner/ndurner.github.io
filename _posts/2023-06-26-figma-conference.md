There was quite some insightful AI-themed content at Figma Conference "Config 23":

- **GPT-4 case study** by Duolingo: "[Designing with AI: building the flagship GPT-4 language product](https://youtu.be/zqUi3p-o8wU)": insights into the design process of an entirely new product (Duolingo Max) around GPT-4, offered from a perspective of non-engineers. One example of what they realized didn't work in terms of continued user engangement: a plain chatbot where the user would need to initiate "a session", like "ask me something". Rather they found that a personalized setting, like with a slightly whacky language tutor, where the chatbot (so GPT-4) looks for mistakes and offers advice, works well.

- "[AI and the future of design: Designing with AI](https://youtu.be/bslH4Mv1ZHA?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F)"; aspects I found new/noteworty:
  - idea: move from "atoms" up the stack to patters, letting AI do the monotonous work in Figma: [Timestamp 7:05](https://youtu.be/bslH4Mv1ZHA?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=425)
  - use prompts to chain plugins together: [Timestamp 12:45](https://youtu.be/bslH4Mv1ZHA?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=765). This seems different from Google I/O, where I got the impression that their tendency is to hide the prompts away (on mobile - so it's not entirely an apples/apples comparison, admittedly). It's interesting to see prompts to take hold as a UX paradigm.

- "[AI and empowering creative careers](https://youtu.be/BJPrRpmeFfE?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F)"
  - Talking point: "**Commercially safe** models" ([Timestamp 08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJPrRpmeFfE&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=482)):
    - Adobe Firefly not knowing who [Spiderman and Mickey Mouse](https://youtu.be/BJPrRpmeFfE?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=524) are, is a feature, not a bug.
    - "Top" results returned should be ["sorted by" / sampled by diversity](https://youtu.be/BJPrRpmeFfE?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=578)
    - (when talking about the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://youtu.be/BJPrRpmeFfE?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=726), Blockchain/Distributed Ledger was **not** a **talking point. This contrasts with e.g. Wacom)

- Other mildly interesting **big-picture** style talk:
  - "[The crescendo of AI in our collective future](https://youtu.be/fS5Sqw_Ba8U?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F)".
    - "these large language models, when you have hundreds of billions of parameters, it's turning computer science more into like a natural science" ([Timestamp 3:29](https://youtu.be/fS5Sqw_Ba8U?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=209))
    - "I think we're kind of in Web 1.0 of AI, and there's 2.0 coming. Where we are right now is with generative AI, and I think what's next is kind of agentive AI, so systems that can actually take action in the world for us [...] So then, that's the question: like when does a language model ever push back on you and tell you this is not the right course of action? I think we should do this instead. And there's a whole bunch of skills involved in reasoning, like knowing when to ask questions, clarify, playing out a scenario, and deciding, "Oh, this is not the right way to go. I should do this other thing instead."" ([Timestamp 4:25](https://youtu.be/fS5Sqw_Ba8U?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx61IdqXh3jrvopJN8HGkS5F&t=267))
