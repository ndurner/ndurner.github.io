In discussions about the regulation of AI services under European law, ChatGPT is in focus — this time concerning the Digital Services Act (DSA). Prompted by a [commentary by Luca Bertuzzi on MLex](https://www.mlex.com/mlex/articles/2339236/chatgpt-s-eu-digital-rulebook-designation-could-slow-innovation-create-precedent), a [LinkedIn exchange](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luca-bertuzzi-186729130_dsa-activity-7328373800549453824-JHO7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw) recently debated whether ChatGPT qualifies as a "Very Large Online Search Engine" (VLOSE) under the DSA framework. My contributions focused on clarifying key distinctions in how AI systems and their underlying models are perceived and regulated.

## Background: ChatGPT and the DSA

The European Commission is considering designating OpenAI's ChatGPT as a VLOSE under the DSA. The reasoning is that ChatGPT incorporates significant web search functionality, potentially reaching the 45-million monthly user threshold that triggers stricter regulatory obligations. This development raised considerable debate on LinkedIn, especially regarding the technical definitions and implications of such a classification.

## System vs. Model: A Necessary Distinction

A core aspect I highlighted in the discussion is the frequent conflation between AI systems (like ChatGPT) and the underlying AI models (such as GPT-4o and others) powering these services. [Citing Miles Brundage](gen-ai-models-systems-use-cases), a former OpenAI policy researcher, I emphasized that distinguishing between AI systems and AI models is essential for informed regulatory decisions. Brundage's talk, ["Where and when does the law fit into AI development and deployment?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j4U2UzJWfI&t=5728s), provides valuable insights into this distinction.

## Is ChatGPT a Search Engine?

Some commentators, notably Barry O’Sullivan, argued that ChatGPT should not be classified as a search engine at all. In response, I argued that ChatGPT indeed may qualifies — or at least potentially qualifies — as a search engine, pointing out its integrated web-search capabilities. Specifically, I cited its built-in Search mode, Deep Research mode, and the new "o3 agentic tool-use" mode, all capable of retrieving and synthesizing web content.

This nuance is crucial: the original ChatGPT release operated purely as a language model generating text based solely on training data, whereas today's ChatGPT actively incorporates external web content into its responses, fundamentally altering its operational model.

## Implications of Misclassification

While acknowledging ChatGPT's current functionality as a potential search engine, I remarked that extending the same regulatory scrutiny indiscriminately to underlying AI models would overreach. AI models themselves — like GPT-4o or the recently announced GPT-4.1 — do not inherently function as search engines; they merely form the computational backbone on which systems like ChatGPT build additional, search-related functionalities. Applying the DSA's off-cycle risk-assessment triggers to new base models would therefore represent a regulatory overreach, significantly deviating from the text and intention of existing EU regulations.
