I have published Aileen 3, a Generative AI system to help with cutting down on the steady information (over-)flow through podcasts, conference sessions etc. Its predecessor [Aileen 2](https://open.substack.com/pub/ndurner/p/aileen?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web) was about building personalized summaries of German parliament proceedings. Aileen 3 broadens the scope and narrows the output by moving to the concept of expectation-driven information foraging.

As conference talks like to rehash at length what was discussed before elsewhere, the key approach of Aileen 3 is a personalized, contrastive approach to AI-driven summarization. Grounded in cognitive science, perceived novelty is treated as surprises.
