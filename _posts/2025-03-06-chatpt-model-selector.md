Ethan Mollick recently shared a tongue-in-cheek remark on how to choose between various ChatGPT "models" ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_when-picking-among-the-9-ai-models-that-are-activity-7301077399763320832-Z8MV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw), [X](https://x.com/emollick/status/1895308482028675291), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lj7heghmgc2x)). My inital suggestion of creating a decision chart to simplify navigating the ChatGPT user interface had received positive feedback, so I have [created a first draft here](/chatgpt_selector/chatgpt-selector). Meanwhile, Peter Gostev compiled a "Feature Status" sheet of ChatGPT - these two pieces [are great complement to each other](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7302830959681261571?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7302830959681261571%2C7302839567450075136%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287302839567450075136%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7302830959681261571%29).

First reactions are positive, and with the recent rollout of GPT 4.5 to more subscription types and usage tiers, this chart is so relevant now that I am sharing this here.
