Amazon have launched a preview of Titan Image Generator - three screencaps from the AI/ML keynote attached below. This is very similar to the DALL-E that is available through [labs.openai.com](http://labs.openai.com) (DALL-E 2?):

- only very limited resolutions available, both for Generation and Editing (screenshot #4).
- result is always PNG

Unlike DALL-E:

- I haven't been able to gotten the Edit to really work (screenshot #5 -> #6, #7 -> #8 face changed even though I had only defined the editing rectangle around the shirt and asked for a blue one)
- You cannot work on a full resolution photo (DALL-E just restricts the editing area)

I couldn't find any watermarks (screencap #3) in the finished result. Either they are not part of the Preview, or they are at least in a different format & style from the ones applied by Adobe Firefly.

Speaking of **Adobe Firefly**: I had success with one photo by using it on iPad: [the brush bug](/adobe-firefly-case-study) didn't show, and neither did the image noise in the result download. Either there was a major bugfix release or it's simply a "Mobile First" app. ðŸ˜‰

The Verge on the watermark:
> The catch, though, comes with how the invisible watermark is detected. Amazon created an API that people can connect to and then feed the image to check the imageâ€™s provenance. Philomin said this is by design; after all, Titan is not an end product but a model, so developers building with Titan Image Generator will choose how to provide that information to users.
