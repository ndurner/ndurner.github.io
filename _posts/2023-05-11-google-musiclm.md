description: "Field-tested Google MusicLM via AI Test Kitchen; finds response randomness, poor 90s-quality audio, short clips, no revisions, history, or downloadsâ€”far from production-ready."
---

As someone who's spent quite some money on Focus@Will, I was excited to get an invite to Google MusicLM (under the "AI Test Kitchen" umbrella). Unfortunately, it's *so* bad:
* prompts take little effect, it's more like a random generator. Could not even reproduce the example from the abstract of the paper.
* very poor audio quality, like on a 90ies phone call
* very short, 20s pieces are long. No infinite loop.
* no iterative collaboration with the AI on the result
* no history - close the browser, results gone
* no download offered (not that you would want that trash, but...)

Focus@Will are under no threat as of now ðŸ™‚
