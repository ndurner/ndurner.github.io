Outlet "TestingCatalog" reports that Microsoft is testing several new features for Copilot. As part of the prompt field, there are "Think Deeper", "Deep Research" and "Action" ([TestingCatalog blog post](https://www.testingcatalog.com/copilot-experiments-reveal-deep-research-podcasts-and-actions/)]. The latter may replicate [OpenAI Operator and "Computer Use"](operator-testdrive), but that's not certain. OpenAI Operators runs inside a cloud VM, but TestingCatalog remarks: "It’s not yet known whether this would work directly from the web or be limited to the Edge browser".

Further pre-release additions include "Pages" (like ChatGPT Canvas), image generation based on [GPT-4o ImageGen](gpt4o-image-generation) and "Podcasts". ([source](https://www.testingcatalog.com/microsoft-copilot-starts-testing-agent-actions-and-adds-native-image-generation/)).
