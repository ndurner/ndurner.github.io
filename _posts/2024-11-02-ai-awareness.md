For those who do NOT use AI or are skeptical, I’ve put together a short, no-frills 7:48 medley from recent OpenAI webinars for business. I’m not advocating the use of these tools, but I think it’s useful for everyone to get a quick yet faithful yet optimistic impression:

Pink remarks in the [Clip on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3AtCPlUX2Lg) are mine.

WirtschaftsWoche, a German business magazine and key source to decision makers, [features German-led (but US-based) AI startup uiAgent](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/dienstleister/uiagent-dieses-deutsche-ki-start-up-will-die-haelfte-der-bueroarbeitsplaetze-ersetzen/30131296.html). Having [prototyped something somewhat similar](aileen) and with top AI Labs preparing launches ([1](https://youtu.be/ODaHJzOyVCQ), [2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maya-murad_opensource-activity-7272667635044028418-Zir-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), [3](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-nears-launch-of-ai-agents-to-automate-tasks-for-users), and more), their core tech appears unremarkable to me. But their overall narrative is:
* replacing up to 50% of office jobs with their technology mid-term, taking on competitors such as UiPath and targeting also mid-sized businesses through affordable automation
* "Large **Action** Model" vs. "Large Language Model"; "no hallucination"
* Human-in-the-loop spin: “In the future, the job market will primarily demand experts who can manage AI - essentially serving as managers for digital workers.”

Ethan Mollick in his book Co-Intelligence¹ strikes a more nuanced tone (chapter 5: "AI as a coworker"), but confirms the danger of AI undermining apprenticeship-style professional education (chapter 8).

The Microsoft Azure blog references [300+ real-word business AI transformation stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/02/05/https-blogs-microsoft-com-blog-2024-11-12-how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/). Most of the customer stories cluster within the core themes of productivity, customer engagement, document automation, operational streamlining and new product innovation. For example, DocuSign used Azure AI to develop its Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, which supports millions of workflows, reducing contract processing times and enhancing customer satisfaction with advanced AI-powered analytics. Others I recognize include [AIA](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/21062-aia-group-dynamics-365-customer-service) (insurance: customer service), [Raiffeisen Bank International](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/21406-raiffeisen-bank-international-azure) (document intelligence etc) and Zurich ([insurance](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1835402038421112318-zurich-azure-openai-service-insurance-en-switzerland): underwriting etc.).

The Stanford HAI 2025 trend report shows that Italy is behind the global average on AI skills - particularly women (0.61 relative rate).

Thus linking to the new [OpenAI Academy](https://academy.openai.com/) and tonight's [Beginner's Course on ChatGPT](https://academy.openai.com/public/events/introduction-to-chatgpt-n5wgdibtb4) as a foundational "AI Literacy" building block.
