## Introduction
OpenAI has released the much anticipated GPT-5 model. [System card](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-system-card/). [It comes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) in four flavors: nano, mini, [chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-chat-latest), and ["gpt-5" proper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5). Some of these were beta-tested through the OpenRouter platform under the disguise of "Horizon Alpha" and "Horizon Beta". The [Using GPT-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latest-model) document details features and includes a migration guide from previous models.

## Horizon Alpha/Beta
The models showed two particularities in my testing:
* gender bias like [GPT-4.1](_openai-api-gpt-4.1): When asking to assign names to term as [highlighted in the Stanford AI Index](stanford-ai-index.md), Horizon Alpha and Beta both showed this bias - which I haven't seen with GPT-4o
* thinking, deliberating on the solution *within* the comments of source code they produced - leading to a lot of non-helpful clutter in the comments

## Reasoning switch
As established for other reasoning models, the length of the reasoning process can be [somewhat shortened](reasoning-models-no-think). GPT-5 makes this explicit, by extending the reasoning effort parameter to include "minimal". In addition, the `verbosity` level is now configurable, allowing outputs aside from the reasoning process to be more terse:
> When generating code, medium and high verbosity levels yield longer, more structured code with inline explanations, while low verbosity produces shorter, more concise code with minimal commentary.
