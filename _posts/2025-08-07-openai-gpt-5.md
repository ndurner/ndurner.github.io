## Introduction
OpenAI is expected to release the much anticipated GPT-5 model tonight. [It comes](https://archive.is/2025.08.07-035308/https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-06-gpt-5-is-now-generally-available-in-github-models/) in four flavors: nano, mini, chat and "gpt-5" proper. Some of these were beta-tested through the OpenRouter platform under the disguise of "Horizon Alpha" and "Horizon Beta".

## Horizon Alpha/Beta
The models showed two particularities in my testing:
* gender bias like [GPT-4.1](_openai-api-gpt-4.1): When asking to assign names to term as [highlighted in the Stanford AI Index](stanford-ai-index.md), Horizon Alpha and Beta both showed this bias - which I haven't seen with GPT-4o
* thinking, deliberating on the solution *within* the comments of source code they produced - leading to a lot of non-helpful clutter in the comments
