Esteemed AI expert and educator Ethan Mollick recently shared a tongue-in-cheek remark on how to choose between various ChatGPT "models" ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_when-picking-among-the-9-ai-models-that-are-activity-7301077399763320832-Z8MV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAGX2jIBd6RDsNRYv13Bvu3x4nnCNu96SEw), [X](https://x.com/emollick/status/1895308482028675291), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lj7heghmgc2x)).
